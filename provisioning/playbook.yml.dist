# more explanation, please refer to the rawbot-virtualization README

# For some part, multiple roles are proposed, just uncomment the ones
# you need.

    ## Install some base packages and configuration files, this should be ok for all projects
    - { role: base }

    ## depending on your choice here.
    # - { role: mysql }
    # - { role: postgresql }
