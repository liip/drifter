## [First Blood](https://github.com/liip/drifter/commit/ce825ff5a860fe8ccffb6ac3277a9278f7685a74) - 2014-09-26

Hackish try to do something using Docker to achieve the same purpose as today.
The idea was fairly quickly abandoned because it was too complicated to manage
the fact that we have people on multiple platforms.

Some of the roles still survives today, so not everything was lost ;)

## Added
- Roles : Apache, PHP
