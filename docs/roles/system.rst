System Roles
************

Base
====

This roles installs various useful software like vim, ack-grep, etc. It
also put some configuration files of the vagrant user home directory.

It should always be included to have a common environment in all vagrant
boxes.

Git
===

Install Git and some sane configuration and sync the username and e-mail
from the host.

`Fancy-diff <https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy>`__ is also
installed by default and you can opt-in to sync your git configuration
on each ``vagrant up``.

Parameters
----------

-  **fancy\_diff** : install fancy-diff
-  **sync\_git\_with\_host** : sync your host git config on each
   ``vagrant up``

Supervisor
==========

Install Supervisor so that you can manage long lived processes inside
the box. A config file based on the parameters is also created for your
service.

The service are automatically started on boot and restarted if they
fail.

If you need multiple services, just include the role multiple times with
the various parameters.

Parameters
----------

-  **service\_name** : name of the service
-  **user** : user to use to launch the service
-  **command** : the command to launch
-  **root\_directory** : the base directory for the service
-  **environment\_vars** : environment vars you want to set

tmpfs
=====

Configure a path to be mounted as a tmpfs (ie : in memory filesystem).

This can be used to speed up application, for example by putting their
log directory in memory thus avoiding costly network transfers for
shared directories.

Parameters
----------

-  **mount\_path** : the path to replace with a tmpfs

SSL
===

If you set the ``ssl`` parameter to true in your ``parameters.yml``
file, ansible will create a Certification Authority (CA) and then create
and sign SSL certificates for all hosts configured for your project.

The CA certificate will then be copied to your project
``root_directory``. If you add this certificate to your trust store, you
should be able to access your websites with HTTPS without any error
messages from most browsers.

If the role is activated, both Apache and NGinx will be configured to
use the created certificates.

WARNING: if the certificate is regenerated because you did a
``vagrant destroy`` or the hostname changed, you will need to re import
the CA certificate into your trust store and in the meantime you might
get errors from your browser. Chrome for example produce a pretty
confusing error message about an attacker trying to steal your
credentials.

SSH
===

Disable SSH strict host key checking if ``ssh_no_stricthostkeychecking``
is set to true in the parameters.

Also add the github and gitlab.liip.ch host key to the ``known_host``
file.

Parameters
----------

-  **ssh\_no\_stricthostkeychecking** : if set to true, disable SSH
   strict host key checking

Redis
=====

RabbitMQ
========

To be completed.

LogStash
========

Currently only installs LogStach without any kind of configuration or
nothing. This role is not usable as is.

Parameters
----------

-  **logstash\_version**: version to install, defaults to 2.3
