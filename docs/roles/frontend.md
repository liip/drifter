    * Watch & live reload with BrowserSync
    * Compile Sass with Autoprefixer & source-maps
    * Bundle JavaScript with Webpack, preconfigured with Babel (optional)
    * Lossless images optimization with ImageMin
* Create associated `gulp.config.js` and `webpack.config.js`
* Create the `package.json` containing the necessary dependencies to be installed with NPM.

After the first provisioning, you should edit the `gulp.config.js` and `webpack.config.js` to match your project structure.

## Parameters

* **gulp_directory**: where should the gulpfile be created, defaults to `<project_dir>/`
* **gulp_package_json_path**: where should the package.json file be created, defaults to `<gulp_directory>/package.json`

## Default tasks

### Watch & live reload proxy
Run BrowserSync, watch for changes in files, compile and reload browser afterwards with:

```
npm start
```

### Build for production
```
npm run build
```

### Optimize images

_For performance reason, this task is not included in the watch/build tasks. You should run it manually according to your needs._

```

# Compass
**This role is deprecated, just as Compass is no longer supported.**

Install Compass and incidentally Sass via `apt-get`. The Ruby role is installed as dependency.
